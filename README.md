# RAG-chatbot-with-real-time-web-search
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can answer user queries using both local documents and real-time web search. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained data, this system dynamically retrieves relevant information to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.
